### Basic Tutorials
In the directory named `models`, you will see the model I built below:

1. `SinglePair_1DoF.slx` : Research **a pair of arm** that 1 Degree of Freedom.
2. `Euler_3DoF.slx` : Research **gimbal** that 3 Degrees of Freedom.
3. `Height_1DoF.slx` : Research **altitude** that 1 Degree of Freedom.
4. `Position_2DoF.slx` : Research **position 2D** that 2 Degrees of Freedom.
5. `Comphrensive_6DoF.slx` : Research **all above** that 6 Degrees of Freedom.

### Advanced Tools
To use this technique in the real engineerings, I have made some useful tools:

1. Real-Time Simulation Connected with **Embedded MCU**;
2. Real-Time Simulation Connected with **ROS**.
